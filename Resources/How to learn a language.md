# How to learn a language
## Info
This is a guide on an effective method on how to learn a language. Please remember that other methods might work just as well, but this one is thought to be effective.

If there are suggestions about what should be in the list, or advices for how it can be improved, they would be greatly appreciated (contact matthew96521 or fairyhmm on Discord).

## Notes:
- ðŸ”´: Mandatory. It is required in order to be fluent in the language.
- ðŸŸ¡: Optional. These are not essential and can be boring, but they significantly boost the process.

## Steps
### 1. Orthography ðŸ”´
- If the alphabet(s) of the target language(s) are different from one's languages, it is a good idea to learn them before starting the language.

### 2. Basic vocab ðŸŸ¡
- Learn phrases of regular uses, such as
    > I have been learning X for a week.

- Learn basic vocabulary and grammar. SRSs (spaced repetition systems), such as Memrise or Anki, can be very helpful for vocab while learning the most the common words, or ones that are used regularly.
- For grammar, it can be researched. Alternatively, softwares such as Busuu can help assisting this process. Refer to [this guide](https://github.com/FairyHmm/Language/blob/main/Resources/Language%20learning%20resources%20-%20Matteo.md) for a more comprehensive list.

### 4. Input ðŸ”´
- Start exposing to native content in some form. This is a theory called "Comprehensiable Input" or "Language Aquisition", where one listens or reads native content, and (usually subconciously) figures it out from context. [This video](https://youtu.be/J_EQDtpYSNM) explains this nicely.
- It's a good idea to start with a slower speed, contents meant for learners, or generally easier contents like children's shows. Talking to natives is a brilliant way to do this, as it helps practising writing and/or speaking, and getting input at the same time.

### 5. PracticingðŸŸ¡
In combination with the step above:
- Looking up unsure words or grammar is a good idea.
- Practising speaking, writing, listening, and reading, either with other people, or by oneself, will greatly help.
