# How to learn a language
## Info
This is a guide on an effective method on how to learn a language. Please remember that other methods might work just as well, but this one is thought to be effective.

If there are suggestions about what should be in the list, or advices for how it can be improved, they would be greatly appreciated (contact `matthew965` or `fairyhmm` on Discord).

## Notes:
- 游댮: Mandatory. It is required in order to be fluent in the language.
- 游리: Non-essential. These are not required and can be boring, but they significantly boost the process, and should be used in combination with mandatory steps, and not separately and all at once.

## Steps
### 1. Orthography 游댮
- If the alphabet(s) of the target language(s) are different from one's languages, it is a good idea to learn them before starting the language.
- Familiarise oneself with the letters, their names, and their pronunciation in the target language. Practice writing them and saying their sounds out loud.

### 2. Basic vocabulary 游리
- Learn phrases of regular uses, such as
    > I have been learning X for a week.

- Learn basic vocabulary and grammar. SRSs (spaced repetition systems), such as Memrise or Anki, can be very helpful for vocabulary while learning the high-frequency words and phrases.
- Use context and associations: Connect new words to concepts or images in one's mind to make them more memorable. Try to understand the words in context by reading or listening to sentences where the word is used. This will help with the meaning and usage of the word naturally.

### 3. Basic grammar 游리
- For grammar, it can be researched. Alternatively, resources such as Busuu can help assisting this process. Refer to [this guide](https://github.com/FairyHmm/Language/blob/main/Resources/Language%20learning%20resources%20-%20Matteo.md) for a more comprehensive list.
- Break down the resources. Rather than overwhelming oneself with all grammar rules at once, focus on one topic at a time. Breaking down the grammar into smaller topics makes it more manageable and easier to grasp.

### 4. Input 游댮
- Start exposing to native content in some form. This is a theory called "Comprehensiable Input" or "Language Aquisition", where one listens or reads native content, and (usually subconciously) figures it out from context. [This video](https://youtu.be/J_EQDtpYSNM) explains this nicely.
- It's a good idea to start with a slower speed, contents meant for learners, or generally easier contents like children's shows. Talking to natives is a brilliant way to do this, as it helps practising writing and/or speaking, and getting input at the same time.

### 5. Practicing 游리
- Looking up unsure words or grammar is a good idea.
- Practising speaking, writing, listening, and reading, either with other people, or by oneself, will greatly help.
- Gradually comprehend and review grammar and vocabularies by using them regularly.
