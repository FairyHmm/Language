# Language Learning Tips
## Do not give up
Remember that everyone learns differently, so if certain methods do not work, trying other ones could help.

## Build a habit
Build a pattern of learning the target language(s), it is reccomended to use habit trackers, or counting the number of days spent learning the language(s)

## Motivation
Have reasons why to learn the target language(s), and remind oneself about it, especially when demotivated.

Try to have fun, as it keeps the motivated mood, and it helps one to enjoy it more.

## Eexpectation
Do not expect to see progress when learning several languages at once, and instead doing things such as an hour of studying per day.

Do not trust every piece of advice seen online.
