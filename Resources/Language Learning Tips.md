# Language Learning Tips
## Stay determined
- Remember that everyone learns differently, so if certain methods do not work, trying other ones could help.

## Build a habit
- Build a pattern of learning the target language(s), it is reccomended to use habit trackers, or counting the number of days spent learning the language(s).

## Motivation
- Have reasons why to learn the target language(s), and remind oneself about it, especially when demotivated.
- Have fun, as it keeps the motivated mood, and it helps one to enjoy it more.

## Eexpectation
- Set clear and achievable goals. Define what one wants to achieve in your language learning journey and break it down into smaller, manageable goals.
- Do not expect to see progress when learning several languages at once, and instead doing things such as an hour of studying per day.
- Do not trust every piece of advice seen online.
