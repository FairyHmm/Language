# Language Learning Reasources
## Information
This is an organized list of websites / softwares that are good reasources to use for language learning. This is not for any specific languages but many of them will not cover all of them.

I am also byassed towards the comprehensiable input method as I think it's the best and this is based of [my guide](https://discord.com/channels/949775981026115604/949795298178379787/1142076372236386334) in how to learn a language.

If you think something should be in the list that isn't or have advice for what I can improve, please tell me. (Matthew96521)

If a reasource is in bold it means that I don't know it's good for what category it's under.
