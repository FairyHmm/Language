## Information
An organised list of websites, softwares, among others, that are good resources for language learning. This is a general guide and not for any specific languages, though certain entries will not cover all of them.

Please note that the entries are sorted alphabetically, with no specific preferences to any particular services.

If there are suggestions about what should be in the list, or any advice for how it can be improved, they would be greatly appreciated (contact `matthew965` or `fairyhmm` on Discord).

### Notes
- ⚠️: entries with unsure placement
- 💰: paid/subscription based services
- 🔒: freemium services, or free with limitations

### Disclaimer
The author (Matthew) is biased towards the comprehensiable input method, as he believes it is the best, and this is based of [another guide](https://github.com/FairyHmm/Language/blob/main/Resources/How%20to%20learn%20a%20language.md) in how to learn a language.
