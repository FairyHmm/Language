# Old English
## What language is this?

This is Old English, the language spoken in early medieval England. It was brought to Britain by Germanic tribes coming from modern-day northern Germany and southern Denmark in the 5th century. The language became Middle English sometime after the Norman Conquest (1066). The Oxford English Dictionary defines Middle English to start in 1150 though the Old English to Middle English line is partially blurry. The most famous Old English work is the poem Beowulf.

This is not Shakespeare's English (Early Modern English)... though you might see some of us speaking in EME what can I say, thou is a nice word

## How do I start learning Old English?

Check out [TBA] we keep a resource list there for all of y'all to make use of.
Once you start going through some materials, just feel free to ask us any questions you have! Nis nān dysiġ āscung.

Further down, you will find recommended books, grammars and websites

## There's this website that says it'll translate things into Old English for me!

It won't. What that site writes is gibberish, and it's really obvious when you've used it. So don't try and fake us out with it.

## Are there any recommended resources for learning Old English?

It is good to have a grammar book for reference. For this purpose we would recommend Fulk's ["An Introductory Grammar Of Old English"](https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/25547/Fulk_Print4.pdf?sequence=3).

Other grammar books will also work. Starting with the shortest grammar book may be a better idea than starting with the longest as a beginner.

Grammars aren't great resources to learn Old English from besides raw grammatical information (if that's your thing - go for it!) so other book recommendations are in order:
- First Steps in Old English by Pollington will introduce grammar concepts one by one, give plenty of practice in translating both from and to Old Engish, give some (highly glossed and annotated!) readings in Old English and teach you like an extant language textbook would! It also builds a nice vocabulary for your first readings.
- Complete Old English by Atherton teaches you primarily one thing: to read Old English. It will start teaching that in the very first chapter. The explanations of pronunciation in this book are lacking so please refer to our pronunciation guide in ⁠ ⁠Unknown
- First Steps in Anglo-Saxon by Sweet is a bit dated, but introduces the basics of Old English grammar in the shortest way possible (only 25 pages!) and then lets you have a go at translating 3 neo-Old-English texts edited by a highly skilled user of the language (Sweet himself). These texts are very straightforward and would make good texts for your first readings. 
- [OE aerobics](http://www.oldenglishaerobics.net/anthology.html) doesn't teach, but gives you opportunity to practice stuff via simple drills and it has plenty of reading with glosses for each word and idiom and with some notes as well. It is a highly recommended resource for all fans of Old English.

## Do you have a nice dictionary to recommend to me?

It's called [Bosworth-Toller](https://bosworthtoller.com/)! Many other dictionaries are less trustworthy. BT is a bit old-style as it's quite old so keep that in mind. You can click "advanced search" and then switch your search settings to "definitions and translations" to go from Modern English to Old English

## How do I say hello?

You don't. The concept of a "hello" is fairly modern. To greet people in Old English you may wish them good health instead. 

||||
| --- | --- | --- |
| Beo/Wes ðu hal! | Be thou well! | singular |
| Beoð/Wesað ge hale! | Be you well! | to men, plural |
| Beoð/Wesað ge hala! | Be you well! | to women, plural |
| Beoð/Wesað ge hal! | Be you well! | to mixed group, plural |

## What's the difference between ð and þ? Is it like Icelandic?

Old English spelling is not like Icelandic spelling! In Old English þ, ð and th are interchangeable as you see fit. The pronounciation of these (ð, þ, th) is based on their position within a word and not on the symbol used. Please refer to [TBA] for more details.

## How do I type Old English symbols?

There are several options:
- Icelandic keyboard gives access to þ, ð and æ and can be accessed both on a phone and on a PC. Install it by searching in your language (keyboard) settings.
- Using macro programs such as [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) or [Microsoft PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) to type characters.
- Make your own by using Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator. This will allow you to select which symbols you want and where you want them. Important note: The program sometimes fails depending on where you install it. To make sure it works install it directly in a folder on one of your disks. Example:
    - `This PC > (E:) > MSKLC folder` this will work
    - `This PC > (E:) > Program Files > MSKLC folder` this might fail

Once you are done with the program it will create an installation package which you can then install and apply via language (keyboard) settings. A restart of your PC might be required.
More detailed guides for MSKLC are available on youtube.

### Note:
MSKLC might require .Net framework 3.5 to be installed. Newer versions of .Net framework are compatible with the old version .Net framework, and chances are you will need the old (3.5) version for the MSKLC program to work.

## Which symbols do I need when making my own keyboard?

The 3 absolute necessities are æ, ð and þ. If you want to use an Anglian dialect then œ becomes useful for words like œðel.

Macrons and dots can be used primarily for learning purposes, but these are mostly a modern invention (see notes).
Hence you might want: Āā Ēē Īī Ōō Ūū Ȳȳ Ǣǣ Œ̄œ̄ Ġġ Ċċ.

Other symbols may also be used:
|||
| --- | --- |
| ⁊ | and |
| ꝥ | þæt |
| · | a dot instead of a full stop or a comma |
| Ƿƿ | Wynn instead of Ww |

You can also find insular fonts online to be used in programs like word.

### Notes
The Anglo-Saxons did actually use macrons in word endings, however the actual meaning was to show the "missing" consonant.

Example: gumā = guman

Modern day we use macrons to show long vowels instead.
The Anglo-Saxons also used accents (like á), but they didn't do it fully consistently to mark long vowels. In manuscripts these are most often found on long vowels, though the usage isn't clear.
